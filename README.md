## Task
We are given data of 13 sensors for 10 years. We are trying to predict output 9th to 13th sensor FOR 10th year, and to check the closeness of result we are calculating RMSE 

## Model Used
I tried solving the problem using Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Random forest regressor and XGBost Regressor. XGBost Regresssor is giving the best results among the 3 models
We have used Light Gradient Boosting Machine for solving this problem.

## Results
The RMSE value of the final model is 26.5067
